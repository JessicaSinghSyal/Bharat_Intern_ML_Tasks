Machine Learning Projects: Wine Quality Prediction and Iris Flower Classification


1. Wine Quality Predictor ML Project

Basic Description:

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on chemical attributes. The dataset consists of 1599 wine samples with 11 features, each labeled with a quality rating from 0 to 10.

Data Preprocessing:

Missing Data: No missing values in the dataset.
Scaling: Features were scaled using Min-Max scaling.
Encoding: No categorical variables; all features are numerical.
Functions Used

Model Selection: Random Forest regression.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search for optimal hyperparameters.
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2) score.
Cross-Validation: 5-fold cross-validation for model assessment.
Software Used

Python Libraries:
scikit-learn (v0.24.2)
pandas (v1.3.3)
numpy (v1.21.2)
matplotlib (v3.4.3)
seaborn (v0.11.2)
flask (v2.1.1)
Prediction

Model: Random Forest regression.
Model Performance:
MAE: 0.42
RMSE: 0.56
R2 Score: 0.35
Classifier Used

Random Forest regression was employed as the predictive model for quality rating.
Successfully Conducted

The project was successfully conducted and completed as part of the Bharat Intern Virtual Internship Program.




2. IRIS Flower Classification Project

Basic Description:

This project focuses on the classification of IRIS flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset comprises 150 samples with four features per sample.

Data Preprocessing:

Missing Data: No missing values in the dataset.
Scaling: Features were standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Encoding: Species labels encoded into numerical values (0 for Setosa, 1 for Versicolor, and 2 for Virginica).
Functions Used

Model Selection: Several classifiers were explored, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search for optimal hyperparameters.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.
Cross-Validation: 5-fold cross-validation for model assessment.
Software Used

Python Libraries:

scikit-learn (v0.24.2)
pandas (v1.3.3)
numpy (v1.21.2)
matplotlib (v3.4.3)
seaborn (v0.11.2)
Prediction

Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Model Performance:
Accuracy: 0.97
Precision: 0.98
Recall: 0.97
F1 Score: 0.97
Classifier Used

Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed as the primary classifier for species classification.
Successfully Conducted

The project was successfully conducted and completed, achieving high accuracy in classifying IRIS flowers into their respective species.
